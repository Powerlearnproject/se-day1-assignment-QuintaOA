Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineeting is the an engineering approach that deals with providing high quality software systems that has gone through good designing, development,testing ,deployment and maintenance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages :The programming languages have evoluted from C,c++ to more human understable languages like python

Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s : before this time, software engineering was not commonly known/used.With the evolution, the engineering team so the need of having it as a discipline to assist in having high quality systems/softwares.

Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s: before hand the water fall was the preferred methodology ,but with time it was noted that flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change was critical for high quality and time saving ,hence the evolution/adoption of the agile methodology.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements : Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
development: Writing code and building the software according to the design
specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is the Sequential approach whose idea of performing tasks in the distinct phases are already mapped out from the start to end with fixed timeline and order while Agile methodlody is flexible,iterative and emphasizes continuous feedback and adaptation,hence maximum collaboration to have the product delivered within the shorted timeline.

Examples:
Waterfall methodology:Construction Project,Banking 
Agile methodlody:Developing new website,Recruitment process


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Write code and implementing software solutionsas per the provided design.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans against the requirements.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g Visual Studio,PyCharm and VCS provided tools that allow tracking changes to the source code and coordinating work among team members e.g.Git,Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges:
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle,leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

strategies to overcome the stated challenges:
effective communication
agile methodologies 
prioritization of tasks and 
regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.This is to ensure that each unit of the software performs as intended and meets requirements.
 
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.This is to helps to identify and resolve any issues that may arise when components are combined.

System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.This is toe helps to identify any defects or issues that may arise when the software is deployed to the end users.

Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.This is to help verify that a system meets all of its functional and non-functional requirements for the ends user's acceptance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.This makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: How do I make a cloth to put on?

Clear prompt: How do I draft a round dress with no sleeves for ladies?

The improved prompt is requesting for a draft of a specific cloth (dress) , specifies the dimensions( round and no sleeves) and specifies the gender.
